      NAb = Neutralizing Antibodies ADA = Anti-Drug Antibodies (is also referred to as ATA, or Anti-Therapeutic Antibodies) Baseline evaluable patient for ADA = a patient with an ADA assay result from a baseline sample(s)
        Baseline evaluable patient for NAb = a patient with a NAb assay result from a baseline sample(s)
        Post-baseline evaluable patient for ADA = a patient with an ADA assay result from at least one post-baseline sample
        Post-baseline evaluable patient for NAb = a patient with a NAb assay result from at least one post-baseline sample
        Number of patients positive for ADA = the number of post-baseline evaluable patients for ADA determined to have Treatment Emergent ADA during the study period.
      Number of patients positive for Treatment Emergent NAb = the number (and percentage) of post-baseline evaluable patients for ADA determined to have treatment-induced NAb or treatment-enhanced NAb during the study period.
      Treatment-induced = a patient with negative or missing baseline result(s) and at least one positive post-baseline result. Treatment-enhanced = a patient with positive result at baseline who has one or more post-baseline titer results that are at least 0.60 t.u. greater than the baseline titer result.
      Number of patients negative for Treatment Emergent NAb = number of post-baseline evaluable patients with negative or missing baseline NAb result(s) and all negative post-baseline NAb results, or a patient who is NAb treatment unaffected.
      Treatment unaffected = A post-baseline evaluable patient with a positive result at baseline and (a) where all post-baseline titer results are less than 0.60 t.u. greater than the baseline titer result, OR (b) where all post-baseline results are negative or missing. For any positive sample with titer result less than the minimum reportable titer or any positive sample where a titer cannot be obtained, titer value is imputed as equal to the minimum reportable titer.

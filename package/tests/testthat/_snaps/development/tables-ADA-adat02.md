      ADA = Anti-Drug Antibodies (is also referred to as ATA, or Anti-Therapeutic
        Antibodies)
        Treatment-induced ADA = negative or missing baseline.
        ADA result(s) and at least one positive post-baseline ADA result.
        Transient ADA = ADA positive result detected (a) at only one post-baseline
        sampling timepoint (excluding last timepoint) OR (b) at 2 or more timepoints
        during treatment where the first and last ADA positive samples are separated
        by a period of < 16 weeks, irrespective of any negative samples in between.
        Persistent ADA = ADA positive result detected (a) at the last post-baseline
        sampling timepoint, OR (b) at 2 or more time points during treatment where
        the first and last ADA positive samples are separated by a period ≥ 16
        weeks, irrespective of any negative samples in between.

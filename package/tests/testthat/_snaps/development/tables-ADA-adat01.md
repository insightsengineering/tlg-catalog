      ADA = Anti-Drug Antibodies (is also referred to as ATA, or Anti-Therapeutic Antibodies) Baseline evaluable patient = a patient with an ADA assay result from a baseline sample(s)
        Post-baseline evaluable patient = a patient with an ADA assay result from at least one post-baseline sample Number of patients positive for Treatment Emergent
        ADA = the number (and percentage) of post-baseline evaluable patients determined to have treatment-induced ADA or treatment-enhanced ADA during the study period.
        Treatment-induced ADA = a patient with negative or missing baseline ADA result(s) and at least one positive post-baseline ADA result.
        Treatment-enhanced ADA = a patient with positive ADA result at baseline who has one or more post-baseline titer results that are at least 0.60 t.u. greater than the baseline titer result.
        Number of patients negative for Treatment Emergent ADA = number of post-baseline evaluable patients with negative or missing baseline ADA result(s) and all negative post-baseline results, or a patient who is treatment unaffected.
        Treatment unaffected = A post-baseline evaluable patient with a positive ADA result at baseline and (a) where all post-baseline titer results are less than 0.60 t.u. greater than the baseline titer result, OR (b) where all post-baseline results are negative or missing.
        For any positive sample with titer result less than the minimum reportable titer or any positive sample where a titer cannot be obtained, titer value is imputed as equal to the minimum reportable titer.

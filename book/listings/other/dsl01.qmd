## Data Setup

```{r setup, message=FALSE}
#| code-fold: show

library(scda)
library(dplyr)
library(rlistings)

adsl <- synthetic_cdisc_dataset("latest", "adsl")

out <- adsl %>%
  filter(AEWITHFL == "Y") %>%
  mutate(
    ID = paste(SITEID, SUBJID, sep = "/"),
    ASR = paste(AGE, SEX, RACE, sep = "/"),
    SSADM = toupper(format(as.Date(TRTSDTM), format = "%d%b%Y")),
    STDWD = as.numeric(ceiling(difftime(TRTEDTM, TRTSDTM, units = "days"))),
    DISCONT = ifelse(!is.na(DCSREAS) & toupper(EOSSTT) == "DISCONTINUED", "Yes", "No")
  ) %>%
  select(ID, ASR, TRT01A, SSADM, STDWD, DISCONT)

## Standard Listing

```{r lsting, test = list(lsting = "lsting")}
lsting <- as_listing(
  out,
  disp_cols = names(out),
  main_title = "Listing of Patients with Study Drug Withdrawn Due to Adverse Events"
)

head(lsting, 20)
